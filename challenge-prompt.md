## 🕵️‍♂️ The Challenge

You're a detective investigating a theft at a tech conference. Here's what you know:

### 📋 Basic Information

1. **Theft occurred between:** 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM on March 15th, 2024
2. **Number of suspects:** Five (Alice, Bob, Carol, Dan, and Eve)
3. **Stolen item:** A prototype chip

### 📹 Security Footage Timeline

| Suspect | Entry Time | Exit Time |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Alice   | 1:45 PM   | 3:30 PM   |
| Bob     | 2:15 PM   | 4:45 PM   |
| Carol   | 2:00 PM   | 5:00 PM   |
| Dan     | 3:00 PM   | 4:30 PM   |
| Eve     | 1:30 PM   | 2:45 PM   |

### 🔍 Critical Evidence

- The stolen item (prototype chip) was **confirmed present at 2:30 PM**
- The stolen item was **discovered missing at 4:15 PM**
- **Theft window:** Between 2:30 PM and 4:15 PM

### 💬 Witness Statements

1. **Alice:** "I saw Bob and Carol arguing near the display at 3:00 PM"
2. **Bob:** "I was in the bathroom from 3:45-4:00 PM, Carol can confirm"
3. **Carol:** "I saw Bob leave the bathroom area around 4:00 PM"
4. **Dan:** "I arrived late and saw Eve leaving as I came in"
5. **Eve:** "I left early and never went near the display area"

### 🔢 Technical Evidence

- The display case requires a 6-digit code
- The code is the **smallest 6-digit number** where **each digit appears exactly once**
- When you **reverse the number** and **subtract it from the original**, you get **549,450**
- Formula: N - Reverse(N) = 549,450

### 📞 Phone Records

- Carol made a 15-minute call from **3:45 PM - 4:00 PM**
