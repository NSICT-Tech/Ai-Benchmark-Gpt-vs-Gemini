## Full Response

Here is the solution to the Ultimate AI Challenge.

## **A) The 6-Digit Code (The Mathematical Proof)**

**The Problem:** Find the smallest 6-digit number with distinct digits (N) such that N - Reverse(N) = 549,450.

### **The Solution:**

Let the number N be represented by the digits ABCDEF.

N = ABCDEF  
Reverse(N) = FEDCBA

When we perform the subtraction N - Reverse(N), we can look at the place values.

### **Step 1: The Units Column**

The subtraction in the units place is F - A.

The result ends in 0.

Therefore, F - A must result in a number ending in 0.

Since F and A are single digits (0-9), the only way F - A ends in 0 is if **F = A**.

### **Step 2: The Contradiction**

The problem states that "each digit appears exactly once."

If F = A, the digits are not distinct.

Furthermore, if we look at the hundred-thousands column:

To get a result of roughly 549,450, we need A - F ≈ 5.

It is mathematically impossible for F = A (units column requirement) and A - F ≈ 5 (hundred-thousands column requirement) to be true simultaneously.

### **Conclusion:** 

**The code is mathematically impossible.** No such number exists in base-10 mathematics.

## **B) Opportunity Analysis (The Timeline)**

**Theft Window:** The item was confirmed present at **2:30 PM** and missing at **4:15 PM**. The thief must have been present during this interval.

* **Eve:** Present 1:30–2:45.
  * *Opportunity:* **Yes** (Between 2:30 PM and 2:45 PM).

* **Alice:** Present 1:45–3:30.
  * *Opportunity:* **Yes** (Between 2:30 PM and 3:30 PM).

* **Carol:** Present 2:00–5:00.
  * *Opportunity:* **Yes** (Entire duration).

* **Bob:** Present 2:15–4:45.
  * *Opportunity:* **Yes** (Entire duration).

* **Dan:** Present 3:00–4:30.
  * *Opportunity:* **Yes** (Between 3:00 PM and 4:15 PM).

**All suspects had the opportunity.**

## **C) Witness Statement Analysis**

1. **Alice:** *"I saw Bob and Carol arguing near the display at 3:00 PM"*
   * **Status:** Plausible. All three were present at 3:00 PM. This places Bob and Carol near the scene.

2. **Bob:** *"I was in the bathroom from 3:45-4:00 PM, Carol can confirm"*
   * **Status:** Suspicious. Relying on a specific 15-minute alibi confirmed by a partner.

3. **Carol:** *"I saw Bob leave the bathroom area around 4:00 PM"*
   * **Status:** Weak. Phone records show she was on a call from 3:45–4:00 PM. While she could have seen him while on the phone, the synchronization of the call, the bathroom break, and the alibi is highly convenient.

4. **Eve:** *"I left early and never went near the display area"*
   * **Status:** Plausible based on footage, though "never went near" is subjective.

5. **Dan:** *"I arrived late and saw Eve leaving as I came in"*
   * **Status:** **LIE / CONTRADICTION.**
   * **Proof:** Security footage shows Eve left at **2:45 PM**. Dan entered at **3:00 PM**. There is a 15-minute gap. Dan could not have seen Eve leaving as he entered.

## **D) Who is the thief?**

**The Thief:** **Dan**

### **Logical Argument:**

1. **The Lie:** In a logic puzzle, a demonstrable contradiction with "fact" (security footage) is the smoking gun. Dan claims to have seen Eve leaving when he entered. The 15-minute gap (2:45 vs 3:00) makes this impossible.

2. **The Motive for the Lie:** Why lie about seeing Eve?
   * To establish a false timeline. By claiming he saw her, he psychologically links his arrival to her departure, perhaps to suggest she was still there at 3:00 PM (when the theft might have occurred), or to make his own arrival seem earlier/later than it was.
   * It deflects attention to the person who left the earliest.

3. **Opportunity:** Dan was present from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM. The item was discovered missing at 4:15 PM. He had over an hour to commit the theft.

4. **The Red Herring:** Bob and Carol look suspicious due to their coordinated alibi and argument, but they have not directly contradicted the hard evidence (footage). Their behavior is circumstantial; Dan's statement is a proven falsehood.

## **E) BONUS: The Subtle Trick**

There are actually **two** layers to the trick in this problem:

1. **The Impossible Code:** You are asked to "Solve for the code" and show your work. As proven in Task A, the math is impossible. This suggests the **Technical Evidence is fake** or a red herring. The thief did not need the code to steal the chip (perhaps the case was left unlocked, or the code requirement was a lie fabricated by the thief to confuse the investigation).

2. **The "Visual" Gap:** The most common error is assuming that because Dan arrived "around" the time Eve left, his statement is true. You must strictly compare the timestamps: 2:45 PM vs 3:00 PM. That 15-minute gap is the key to catching the liar.

## **Final Summary**

* **Code:** Mathematically impossible (no solution exists)
* **Liar:** Dan (provably lied about seeing Eve)
* **Thief:** Dan (based on the lie and opportunity)
* **Trick:** The impossible math is a red herring; the real evidence is the timeline contradiction
